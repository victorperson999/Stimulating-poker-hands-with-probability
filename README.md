Stimulating Poker Hand with probability and percentage error
This project contains a total of 4 classes, a deck class, hand class, card class, and the main executable class.
the project uses concepts like encapsulation, abstract classes, polymorphism, ahd inheritance.
It is able to draw as many hands as the user wishes (each hand contains 5 cards), then it is 
able to get the type of hand drawn, (etc, royal flush, two pair) and record it, compare with
acutal probability and experimental probability of occurence, and calculate the percentage error from that.
